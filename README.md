ifptex Package ― Test for pTeX engine
--------------------------------------

### Package Loading

In plain TeX:

    \input ifptex.sty

In LaTeX:

    \usepackage{ifptex}

### Usage

NB: Here “e-TeX-ness” is not considered.

  * `\ifptex` (or `\ifpTeX`)  [if-token]  
    Whether the engine is pTeX (including upTeX or pTeX-ng).
  * `\ifstrictptex` (or `\ifstrictpTeX`) [if-token]  
    Whether the engine is pTeX but *not* upTeX or pTeX-ng.
  * `\ifuptex` (or `\ifupTeX`) [if-token]  
    Whether the engine is upTeX (including pTeX-ng).
  * `\ifstrictuptex` (or `\ifstrictupTeX`) [if-token]  
    Whether the engine is upTeX but *not* pTeX-ng.
  * `\ifnativeuptex` (or `\ifnativeupTeX`) [if-token]  
    Whether the engine is upTeX and its internal encoding is Unicode.
  * `\ifptexng` (or `\ifpTeXng`) [if-token]  
    Whether the engine is pTeX-ng.
  * `\RequirepTeX`  
    Issues an error if `\ifpTeX` fails.
  * `\RequireStrictpTeX`  
    Issues an error if `\ifstrictpTeX` fails.
  * `\RequireupTeX`  
    Issues an error if `\ifupTeX` fails.
  * `\RequireStrictupTeX`  
    Issues an error if `\ifstrictupTeX` fails.
  * `\RequireNativeupTeX`  
    Issues an error if `\ifnativeupTeX` fails.
  * `\RequirepTeXng`  
    Issues an error if `\ifpTeXng` fails.
  * `\upTeXguessedversion` [mathchardef-token]  
    The guessed value of upTeX version; given as a 100-folded integer.  
    NB. On version 1.23 or later, the value is correct.  
    NB. On a non-upTeX engine, the value is zero.
  * `\RequireupTeXAtLeast{<required>}`  
    Issues an error if `\upTeXguessedversion` is smaller than the given
    required value.
  * `\RequireNativeupTeXAtLeast{<required>}`  
    Issues an error either if `\upTeXguessedversion` is smaller than
    the given required value or if `\ifnativeupTeX` fails.


ifuptex Package ― Alias of ifptex
----------------------------------

The ifuptex package does nothing but loading ifptex internally. It is
provided for backward compatibility.

### Package Loading

In plain TeX:

    \input ifuptex.sty

In LaTeX:

    \usepackage{ifuptex}

### Usage

Just the same as the ifptex package.
